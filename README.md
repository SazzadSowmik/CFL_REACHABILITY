# CFL Reachability

The CFL Reachability problem involves determining whether there is a path in a graph where the concatenation of edge labels along the path forms a string that belongs to a given context-free language. This problem extends the standard graph reachability problem to handle context-free languages, making it more expressive and suitable for a range of applications in program analysis.

This project implements the CFL reachability problem for balanced parentheses using C++.
